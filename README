dar_backup:

Script to automate backups using dar. This creates DVD-sized images,
checksums them with parchive then burns them out to a DVD burner. I
have some future improvements to this planned, which are generally
centered around speed. I want to include actually verifying the
archive written out to disk, but that will make things <b>really</b>
slow, so I'll try to parallelize this; something like starting
processing the next chunk while the burn and verify is going on. This
should increase speed over where it is now, because the time taken
will only be the actual encoding process; burning and verifying become
"free". Note that this script was liked so much by the maintainer that
he's been including it in his packages (or so he told me). That said,
I've since gotten to upwards of 50 DVD's on a backup, so I just bought
an external hard drive and use the backup script.


backup:

Current backup script. Creates a hostname-specific subdirectory and
copies the directories specified in the file to it.
